# Named Entity Extraction for BioMedical text

This is the project repository of CIS5528 Project in 2023 Spring, Temple University.

Team Members: Qi Zhang, Yihan Zhang, Xinwen Zhang

## Task Description

## Dataset

We are going to use three kinds of datasets: BC2GM, BC5CDR and NCBI. Recommeding the HuggingFace Dataset Library to load these copora (Click the following dataset name can redict to the HuggingFace dataset page).

1. [BC2GM](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bc2gm_corpus)

2. [BC5CDR](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tner/bc5cdr)

3. [NCBI](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ncbi_disease)

To load these dataset you can try:


## Baselines

1. CRF

2. BiLSTM

3. BERTs

4. GPTs

This is a multi-task approach for biomecial NER models. The main idea of this paper is leveraging multi-level feature of Sequence from both token-level and sequence-level.
